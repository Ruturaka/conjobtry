# DataTransTest
#JobCountryAttr


I have created 2 classes -  RegexBasedCountry (has Regex for each counrty attribute along with tranform method) 
and RegexBasedJobDesc (has Regex for each counrty attribute along with tranform method)
And the Demo class has the test method Tocheck() in it. This class uses above to classes to test & replace the country & job description attributes with it's equivalent attrToBeReplaced. 

O/P  - 

Before Test: 
country: US
Job Description: SR, Account manager

After Test:
country: United States of America
Job Description: Account Manager - OHS
